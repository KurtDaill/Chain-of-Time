	Cato: "It's a scribes room. They would have had new adepts scribing scrolls and books at those desks."
	[ANIM(SilverWalksUp)]
	Silver: "They're ruling the world and don't even think to use a printer. Sounds like humans alright."
	[ANIM(SlowPullOut)]
	Cato: "Magical writing has to be all by hand. The scribe has to act as a conduit between the divine power and the scroll."
	Cato: "It's how they teach new sorceresses to feel the flow of energy."
	[ANIM(SilverLooksAtCato)]
	Silver: "What's a Kell doing knowing do much about human magic?"
	[ANIM(CatoLooksUp)]
	Cato: "My mom, I guess. I was always asking her. I wanted to be a sorcerer."
	[ANIM(SilverLooksUp)]
	Silver: "Did nobody tell you, or?"
	Cato: "They did, and I know...human magic from a human goddess. No room for a Kell."
	[ANIM(FirstPause)]
	Cato: "You know, she was from here. I'd guess she was trained right down there all those years ago..."
	[ANIM(AwkwardPause)]
	Cato: "Let's go. We've got to clear out whatevers still here."
