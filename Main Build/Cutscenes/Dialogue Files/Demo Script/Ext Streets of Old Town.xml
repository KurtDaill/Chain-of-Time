    <!-- Cato runs out into the cobbled streets of the Cityâ€™s old town, right outside his own house. 
        The skyline of the city is turning orange as more and more of the city is beginning to burn. 
        The camera immediately trucks to the right, showing an orc kid, maybe 10 years old, 
        stumbling away from a skeleton steadily marching after him.-->
